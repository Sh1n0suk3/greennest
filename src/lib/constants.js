  information: `
            <p>This house is <em>aggressively</em> eco-friendly. It's built from recycled materials that nobody wanted, and it runs on our advanced solar panels... which only seem to generate power at night. (Peak Ma innovation).</p>
            <p>It's so sustainable that even pests and mold refuse to live here. You will be truly alone with your thoughts. This is the future of green living. You're welcome.</p>
            <p>The 432-year lifespan is a conservative estimate. The house simply refuses to decay, possibly out of pure spite. It's a complex Ma thing.</p>
